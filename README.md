# SOLID Principles with Ruby

This repo aims to serve as a learning platform for SOLID principles via RSpec tests.

## How to run?

There is just on spec file so just run `rspec spec/solid_test` and wait for the results

## What to do?

There are 5 tests, one for each principle and they should all fail out of the box.
Your mission is to identify the violation of the principle for each case and change the code in a way that the test passes.

Of course there's ways of cheating without actually satisfying the principle, but why would you do that? ;)
